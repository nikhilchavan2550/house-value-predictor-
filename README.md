Project Title: House Price Prediction Model with Multivariable Regression

Project Description:

Introduction: In this project, I developed a House Price Prediction model using multivariable regression techniques to estimate residential property values in Boston, Massachusetts, during the 1970s. The aim was to assist a real estate development company in making informed decisions by providing accurate price estimates based on various property characteristics.

Problem Statement: The project aimed to address the challenge of valuing residential properties before development. To achieve this, we needed to predict property prices using a combination of key features such as the number of rooms, distance to employment centers, neighborhood socioeconomic indicators, and student-teacher ratios in local schools.

Key Responsibilities and Achievements:

Data Preparation: Imported and cleaned the dataset using Python libraries, including pandas and numpy, to ensure data quality and consistency.

Data Visualization: Utilized data visualization libraries such as seaborn, plotly.express, and matplotlib.pyplot to gain insights into the dataset. Created visualizations to explore relationships between various features and the target variable (property prices).

Model Development: Employed multivariable regression techniques from scikit-learn, specifically LinearRegression, to build a predictive model. Split the dataset into training and testing sets using train_test_split for model evaluation.

Model Evaluation: Evaluated the model's performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Employed cross-validation to ensure the model's robustness.

Feature Importance: Determined feature importance to identify which characteristics had the most significant impact on property prices. This information provided valuable insights for decision-making.

Result Presentation: Presented the model's predictions and findings in a clear and interpretable manner, making it accessible to non-technical stakeholders.

Technologies and Libraries Used:

Python
Libraries: pandas, numpy, seaborn, plotly.express, matplotlib.pyplot
scikit-learn for machine learning and regression modeling
Outcome:
The developed House Price Prediction model equipped the real estate development company with a reliable tool for estimating property values accurately. By considering multiple property characteristics, the model provides valuable insights for investment decisions, ensuring informed and data-driven choices in the real estate market.
